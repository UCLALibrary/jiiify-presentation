Welcome to the jiiify-presentation project. This project is an attempt to create a Java API for working with the [IIIF Presentation](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/) API. It's currently targeted at the 2.x version (not the upcoming 3.x version). It doesn't contain a server. It is just a software library that can be incorporated into a full-blown server or command line (client-side) application. Feedback on the project is welcome. See the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/ksclarke/jiiify-presentation) for ways to communicate with the developers.
